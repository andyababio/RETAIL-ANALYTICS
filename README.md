## üîÑ Process Flow

Data Preparation (MySQL):
The raw retail data was cleaned and transformed in MySQL to ensure consistency and accuracy across all tables ‚Äî including transactions, customers, products, and dates.

Data Modeling (Power BI):
The cleaned datasets were imported into Power BI, where relationships were defined between fact and dimension tables to create a robust star schema model.

Data Visualization & Analysis:
With the model established, interactive visuals and KPIs were developed in Power BI to highlight trends, relationships, and performance metrics across sales, profit, and customer dimensions.

 - Cust_ID ‚Äì Links each transaction to a specific customer
 - Tran_Date ‚Äì Transaction date (used to connect with the Date table)
 - Prod_Cat_Code / Prod_Sub_Cat_Code ‚Äì Identify product category and subcategory
 - Qty, Rate, Tax, Total_Amt ‚Äì Metrics for financial calculations
 - Profit_Margin_%, Profit ‚Äì Indicators of product-level profitability
 - Store_Type ‚Äì Channel or store type (e.g., online, in-store)

üü• Dimension Table: Customer
 - Customer_ID, DOB, Gender, City_Code

## Conclusion

The analysis provides a holistic view of the business‚Äôs sales, profitability, and customer behavior across products, channels, and demographics. Overall, the company demonstrates strong performance driven by the Books and Electronics categories, a robust e-Shop channel, and a loyal customer base aged 25‚Äì44. Profitability trends indicate effective pricing and cost control, particularly within Footwear, while consistent female-driven profit contributions highlight a reliable customer segment.

However, the data also reveals areas for optimization ‚Äî notably, higher return rates in specific stores (e-Shop) and age groups (45‚Äì54), as well as lower revenue contributions from categories like Bags and Clothing. Addressing these will help balance the business‚Äôs revenue mix and improve overall customer satisfaction.
